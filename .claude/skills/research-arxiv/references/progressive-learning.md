# Progressive Learning Framework — Arxiv Research

Structure for exploring a research topic through recent arxiv papers.

## The Five Levels

### Level 1: Field Overview

**Goal**: Understand the research landscape

Cover:

- What is this research area about?
- Why is it important now? What's driving interest?
- Key subfields or branches within the topic
- How this area connects to broader AI/ML/CS trends
- Essential background knowledge needed to read papers in this area

### Level 2: Key Papers

**Goal**: Know the most important recent work

Cover:

- 5-10 most influential recent papers (title, authors, date, arxiv link)
- One-paragraph summary of each paper's contribution
- How each paper builds on or differs from prior work
- Which papers are foundational vs. incremental advances
- Citation relationships between key papers

### Level 3: Methods & Approaches

**Goal**: Understand the technical approaches being used

Cover:

- Main methodological categories in the field
- Key techniques, architectures, or algorithms
- Common datasets and benchmarks used for evaluation
- State-of-the-art results and how they compare
- Trade-offs between different approaches

### Level 4: Trends & Open Problems

**Goal**: Know where the field is heading

Cover:

- Emerging trends and directions
- Open problems and unsolved challenges
- Debates or controversies in the community
- Gaps in current research
- Promising but under-explored directions

### Level 5: Getting Involved

**Goal**: Know how to engage with the research community

Cover:

- Key conferences and workshops (NeurIPS, ICML, ACL, etc.)
- Research groups and labs to follow
- Arxiv categories and keywords to track
- Community resources (newsletters, podcasts, reading groups)
- Suggest a reading plan: which papers to read in what order
