# Progressive Learning Framework — Comparison Research

Structure for creating a side-by-side comparison of 2-4 alternatives.

## The Five Levels

### Level 1: What & Why

**Goal**: Understand what each alternative is and why it exists

Cover:

- One-paragraph description of each alternative
- The problem each was designed to solve
- Primary use case and target audience for each
- Key differentiator — what makes each unique
- Brief history and current status (active, mature, declining)

### Level 2: Feature Matrix

**Goal**: See capabilities side by side

Cover:

- Create a comparison table with features as rows and alternatives as columns
- Group features by category (e.g., core features, ecosystem, developer experience)
- Use clear indicators (yes/no, ratings, or brief notes)
- Highlight where alternatives are equivalent vs. significantly different
- Note any features that are unique to one alternative

### Level 3: Tradeoff Analysis

**Goal**: Understand the deeper implications of each choice

Cover:

- Performance comparison (with data where available)
- Learning curve and developer experience
- Ecosystem maturity (libraries, plugins, integrations)
- Community size and support quality
- Long-term viability and maintenance outlook
- Cost implications (licensing, hosting, operational)
- For each tradeoff, state who it matters most to

### Level 4: Real-World Fit

**Goal**: Match alternatives to specific use cases

Cover:

- "Choose X if..." statements for each alternative
- Common project types and which alternative fits best
- Team size and skill considerations
- Scale considerations (startup vs. enterprise)
- Migration difficulty if you need to switch later
- Real-world examples of who uses what and why

### Level 5: Decision Framework

**Goal**: Give the user a structured way to decide

Cover:

- A decision flowchart or series of questions to guide the choice
- Weight the most important factors
- "If you're still unsure..." default recommendation with reasoning
- What to prototype or test before committing
- Resources for getting started with each alternative
