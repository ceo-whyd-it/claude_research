# Progressive Learning Framework — Research From Notes

Structure for enhancing local draft files with internet research. Each level builds on the author's original content, layering in verification, expansion, and new context.

## The Five Levels

### Level 1: Problem Space (Validated)

**Goal**: Present the author's topic and verify the framing with research

Cover:

- What topic does the author's draft address?
- Verify the author's framing — is their understanding of the problem accurate?
- Add historical context or background the drafts may assume or omit
- Confirm why this topic matters (validate or expand the author's motivation)
- Flag any fundamental misunderstandings early

### Level 2: Key Players & Solutions (Verified)

**Goal**: Verify entities mentioned in drafts and identify omissions

Cover:

- Verify all tools, frameworks, companies, or people mentioned in drafts
- Confirm version numbers, release dates, and attributions
- Identify key players or solutions the drafts omit
- Categorize mentioned and discovered entities (e.g., by type, maturity, audience)
- Note where the drafts are comprehensive vs. where they have blind spots

### Level 3: Landscape Map (Contextualized)

**Goal**: Place the draft's content in a broader context

Cover:

- Map relationships between entities mentioned in drafts
- Show where the draft's focus sits within the broader landscape
- Add context the author may not have considered (adjacent fields, competing approaches)
- Identify ecosystem dependencies relevant to the draft's topics
- Connect isolated points from the drafts into a coherent picture

### Level 4: Tradeoffs & Considerations (Claims Verified, Gaps Filled)

**Goal**: Systematically check claims, answer questions, and fill gaps

Cover:

- Verify every factual claim from the drafts (with sources)
- Answer every explicit question raised in the drafts
- Fill identified knowledge gaps with researched content
- Add tradeoffs and considerations the drafts don't address
- Correct any inaccuracies with proper sourcing
- Present nuances the drafts may oversimplify

### Level 5: Next Steps (Answered & Directed)

**Goal**: Answer the author's questions and suggest where to go next

Cover:

- Direct answers to all questions from the drafts (with sources)
- Suggest specific deep dives based on the author's apparent interests
- Recommend follow-up skills for further research (e.g., `learning-a-tool`, `research-compare`, `research-paper`)
- Identify areas where the author could contribute original insight
- Provide concrete next actions (read X, try Y, compare Z)
