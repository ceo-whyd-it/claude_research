# Progressive Learning Framework — General Research

Structure for performing a broad landscape scan on any topic.

## The Five Levels

### Level 1: Problem Space

**Goal**: Understand the domain and why it matters

Cover:

- What is this topic about?
- What problem or need does it address?
- Who cares about it and why?
- Historical context — how did we get here?
- Why is this relevant right now?

### Level 2: Key Players & Solutions

**Goal**: Know who and what is in the space

Cover:

- Major companies, organizations, or individuals involved
- Key products, tools, frameworks, or approaches
- Open source vs. commercial offerings
- Categorize by type (e.g., hosted vs. self-hosted, enterprise vs. individual)
- Market leaders vs. emerging alternatives

### Level 3: Landscape Map

**Goal**: See the big picture and how things relate

Cover:

- Organize the space into logical categories or segments
- Map relationships between players and approaches
- Identify clusters, overlaps, and gaps
- Positioning: who serves what niche
- Ecosystem dependencies (what works with what)

### Level 4: Tradeoffs & Considerations

**Goal**: Understand the key decision factors

Cover:

- Common tradeoffs when choosing between approaches
- Cost considerations (money, time, complexity)
- Maturity and stability of different options
- Community size and support quality
- Scalability and performance characteristics
- Common pitfalls and things people wish they knew earlier

### Level 5: Recommended Deep Dives

**Goal**: Know where to go next based on interest

Cover:

- Suggest 3-5 specific deep dives based on common use cases
- For each deep dive, recommend which skill to use next (e.g., `learning-a-tool`, `research-compare`)
- Best starting resources for each direction
- Communities to join for each area
- Questions to ask yourself to narrow your focus
