## The Hook

Start with the counterintuitive thing. What's surprising about this topic?

## The Setup

What do readers need to know to understand the main idea? (Keep this SHORT)

## The Main Idea

This is the ONE thing you're explaining. Go deep here.

### Example or Visual

```javascript
// Working code that demonstrates the concept
```

Or a Mermaid diagram:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Start] --> B[Main Concept]
    B --> C[Insight]
```

## The Insight

What's the takeaway? What can readers now do/say/understand that they couldn't before?

## Connection (Optional)

If this connects to a larger theme, mention it briefly (with link). Don't explain it.
