# Claude Agent Teams — Learning Path

This learning path teaches you how to build multi-agent systems using **Claude Code Agent Teams** and the **Claude Agent SDK**.

## What You'll Learn

- How to orchestrate multiple Claude agents working together
- When to use agent teams vs. single agents or subagents
- Core concepts: agent definitions, task coordination, inter-agent communication
- Building real multi-agent applications (code review, parallel debugging, feature development)
- Best practices for task decomposition, team configuration, and cost optimization

## How to Use This Learning Path

This guide is organized into **5 progressive levels**:

1. **Level 1: Overview & Motivation** — Understand what agent teams are and when to use them
2. **Level 2: Setup & First Project** — Get agent teams running with a minimal example
3. **Level 3: Architecture & Core Concepts** — Learn the mental model and how teams work
4. **Level 4: Building Real Applications** — Build practical multi-agent systems
5. **Level 5: Next Steps** — Advanced topics and where to go deeper

**Suggested path:**
- Read through `learning-path.md` level by level
- Run the code examples in `code-examples/` as you go
- Refer to `resources.md` for links to official docs and community content

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+ or Node.js 18+ (depending on SDK choice)
- Basic understanding of async programming
- Familiarity with Claude API or Claude Code
- Understanding of agent/LLM concepts (helpful but not required)

## Estimated Time

- **Level 1-2 (Setup & Basics):** 30-45 minutes
- **Level 3 (Core Concepts):** 1-2 hours
- **Level 4 (Real Applications):** 2-4 hours
- **Level 5 (Advanced Topics):** Self-paced exploration

Total: 4-8 hours for comprehensive understanding
