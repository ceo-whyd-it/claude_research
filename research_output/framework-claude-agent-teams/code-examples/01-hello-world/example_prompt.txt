Create a simple agent team with 2 teammates:

1. Greeter Agent
   - Task: Create a friendly greeting message
   - Should be creative and welcoming

2. Validator Agent
   - Task: Review the greeter's message
   - Check if it's appropriate and friendly

Have them work together, with the validator providing feedback on the greeting.
