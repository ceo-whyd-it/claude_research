Create an agent team to build a User Profile Update feature across all layers.

Break the work into 4 independent workstreams with clear file ownership:

1. **Database Teammate**
   Role: Create database migration for profile fields
   Files: migrations/001_add_profile_fields.sql
   Tasks:
   - Add profile columns: bio (TEXT), avatar_url (VARCHAR(500)), updated_at (TIMESTAMP)
   - Create index on updated_at
   - Write rollback migration
   - Test migration up/down
   Tools: Read, Write, Bash
   Model: Sonnet
   Dependencies: None

2. **API Teammate**
   Role: Implement profile update API endpoint
   Files: backend/routes/profile.py, backend/tests/test_profile.py
   Tasks:
   - Implement PUT /api/users/:id/profile endpoint
   - Validate input (bio max 500 chars, avatar_url is valid URL)
   - Require authentication (user can only update own profile)
   - Return 200 with updated profile or 400/401/404 on error
   - Write unit tests (success case, validation errors, auth errors)
   Tools: Read, Write, Bash
   Model: Sonnet
   Dependencies: Database teammate must complete migration first

3. **Frontend Teammate**
   Role: Build profile edit React component
   Files: frontend/src/components/ProfileEdit.tsx, frontend/src/components/ProfileEdit.test.tsx
   Tasks:
   - Create ProfileEdit component with form (bio textarea, avatar URL input)
   - Add client-side validation matching API rules
   - Show loading state during save
   - Show success/error messages
   - Write component tests (render, validation, submission)
   Tools: Read, Write, Bash
   Model: Sonnet
   Dependencies: None (can work independently using API contract)

4. **Integration Teammate**
   Role: Write end-to-end tests for full user journey
   Files: tests/e2e/test_profile_update.py
   Tasks:
   - Test complete flow: render form → fill fields → submit → verify database
   - Test validation errors display correctly
   - Test auth required (redirect to login if not authenticated)
   - Test happy path with real database and frontend
   Tools: Read, Write, Bash
   Model: Sonnet
   Dependencies: Both API and Frontend teammates must complete

Instructions for all teammates:
- Work in READ-ONLY mode first
- Create a detailed implementation plan
- Send plan for my approval before implementing
- After approval, implement the plan
- Write tests as you go
- Mark task complete when done

Instructions for me (Team Lead):
- Do NOT implement anything yourself
- Wait for teammates to send plans
- Review and approve each plan
- Let teammates work in parallel where possible
- Wait for all teammates to finish before declaring success

Use Sonnet for all teammates to balance capability and cost.
Require plan approval before any implementation.
