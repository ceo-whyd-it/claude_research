# Learning MLflow

A comprehensive, progressive learning path for MLflow - the open-source platform for managing the complete machine learning lifecycle.

## What is MLflow?

MLflow is an end-to-end platform for:
- **Tracking** experiments and runs
- **Packaging** ML models in reproducible formats
- **Registering** and versioning models
- **Deploying** models to production
- **Tracing** LLM applications and AI agents
- **Evaluating** model quality and performance

## Who is this for?

This learning path is designed for:
- Data scientists starting with ML experiment tracking
- ML engineers building production pipelines
- Teams adopting MLOps practices
- Developers building LLM/GenAI applications
- Anyone managing ML model lifecycles

## How to use this learning path

The content is organized into 5 progressive levels:

### Level 1: Overview & Motivation
Understand WHAT MLflow is and WHY it exists. Learn the problems it solves and when to use it.

### Level 2: Installation & Hello World
Get MLflow running locally with a minimal working example. See immediate results.

### Level 3: Core Concepts
Master the fundamental ideas: Runs, Experiments, Model Registry, Autologging, and Model Flavors.

### Level 4: Practical Patterns
Build real applications with MLflow - from simple training scripts to production LLM systems.

### Level 5: Next Steps
